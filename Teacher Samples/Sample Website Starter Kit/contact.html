Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?</p>
			<p>Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.</p>

			<p>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" That's why you always leave a note! Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. I hear the jury's still out on science. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. <strong>Not tricks, Michael, illusions</strong>.</p>

				<li>Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.</li>
				<li>No&hellip; but I'd like to be asked!</li>
				<li>No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.</li>
